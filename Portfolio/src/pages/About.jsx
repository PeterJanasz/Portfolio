            <p>
                I am a first generation American born in Chicago, IL. My parents are both from Poland and moved here
                in 1980 to pursue their American dream. I am fluent in Polish and have been privileged with the
                opportunity to spend my summers growing up visiting family in Poland and traveling through Europe.
                Traveling is one of my passions which allows me to experience different cultures and perspectives.

                I have worked at Mayo Clinic of Arizona for 18 years. After so many years in the healthcare field, I
                felt it was time for a change. I decided a career in full-stack software development was the best
                fit for me. There are many skills I have acquired from my healthcare experience that apply to this
                new field. Problem solving, prioritizing, multi tasking, and stress management are just a few.
